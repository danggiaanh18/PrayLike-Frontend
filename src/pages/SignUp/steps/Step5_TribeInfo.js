🔹 Genesis 49:5–7 (Jacob's prophecy over Simeon)
"Simeon and Levi are brothers—
their swords are weapons of violence.
Let my soul not enter their council;
let my honor not be united with their assembly.
For in their anger they killed men,
and in their self-will they hamstrung oxen.

• The name signifies that God hears the cries of His people, but it also carries the call for people to listen and obey God's word.

🔹 Deuteronomy 33:8–11 (Moses' blessing over the Tribe of Levi)
"About Levi he said:
Your Thummim and Urim belong to your faithful servant,
whom you tested at Massah
and with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah.
He said of his father and mother, 'I have no regard for them';
he did not recognize his brothers
or acknowledge his own children,
but he watched over your word
and guarded your covenant.
He teaches your precepts to Jacob
and your law to Israel.

Bless all his skills, Lord,
and be pleased with the work of his hands."

Levi in the New Testament Perspective

In the New Testament, Jesus Christ is the only Mediator (1 Timothy 2:5) and our Great High Priest (Hebrews 4:14–16). Through His redemption, every believer is invited into the priestly calling, becoming a "royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:9) with direct access to God.

  11: { // Joseph
    badge: '🍇👑',
    fullDescription: `📖 Scriptural Foundation

🔹 Genesis 49:22–26 (Jacob's blessing over Joseph)
"Joseph is a fruitful vine,
a fruitful vine near a spring,
whose branches climb over a wall.
With bitterness archers attacked him;
they shot at him with hostility.
But his bow remained steady,
his strong arms stayed limber,
because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob,
because of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel,
because of your father's God, who helps you,
because of the Almighty, who blesses you
with blessings of the heavens above,
blessings of the deep that lies below,
blessings of the breast and womb.
Your father's blessings are greater
than the blessings of the ancient mountains,
than the bounty of the everlasting hills.
Let all these rest on the head of Joseph,
on the brow of the one set apart from his brothers."

🔹 Deuteronomy 33:13–17 (Moses' blessing over Joseph)
"About Joseph he said:
'May the Lord bless his land
with the precious dew from heaven above
and with the deep waters that lie below;
with the best the sun brings forth
and the finest the moon can yield;
with the choicest gifts of the ancient mountains
and the fruitfulness of the everlasting hills;
with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness
and the favor of Him who dwelt in the burning bush.
Let all these rest on the head of Joseph,
on the brow of the prince among his brothers.
In majesty he is like a firstborn bull;
his horns are the horns of a wild ox.
With them he will gore the nations,
even those at the ends of the earth.
Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim,
such are the thousands of Manasseh.'"
